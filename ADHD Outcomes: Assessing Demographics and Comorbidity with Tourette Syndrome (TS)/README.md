Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders (CDC, 2022). It often manifests, is first seen, and is diagnosed in children and persists into and throughout adulthood (CDC, 2022). Given that it is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders (CDC, 2022), it behooves the medical community to continually work to diagnose and treat ADHD. Not only that, but because ADHD diagnoses can be tough to nail for all individuals, part of the problem lies in being able to accurately identify ADHD symptoms across the spectrum of those symptoms. 

Currently, a discrepancy likely exists between those formally diagnosed with ADHD and those who exhibit potential ADHD symptoms but have not been formally diagnosed (CDC, 2022). In other words, a good portion of individuals that have ADHD may not be medically diagnosed - and this could be for a variety of reasons. 

In addition to the complexities of ADHD, complexities also lie in Tourette Syndrome (TS) diagnoses. TS, like ADHD, can only be diagnosed via observation – no blood or other biomarker tests can be conducted to ascertain a diagnosis (TAA, 2022). Interestingly enough, TS is a common co-diagnosis with ADHD (and vice versa), but not always. TS is more poorly understood than even ADHD is, and additional medical and demographic research in these areas is critical.

Project Overview & Research Questions:
For this specific project, I wanted to assess ADHD diagnoses and the demographics surrounding that to determine what that landscape looks like. Additionally, I wanted to look at Tourette Syndrome as a comorbidity to ADHD, as well as a variety of factors in relation to those children with ADHD, including overall ADHD information, demographic information, TS information, mental health information, behavioral health information, and overall health information.

I also wanted to explore whether ADHD diagnoses can be predicted based upon the above sets of specific factors.
Based upon that, my main research questions are as follows:

1.	What do the overall demographics and health status looks like for children with ADHD?
2.	What is the relationship between those children who are diagnosed with ADHD and those diagnosed with TS?
3.	Can predictions be made as to an ADHD diagnosis based upon factors such as general health, mental health, demographics, TS diagnosis, etc.?

The data selected for use is the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) 2019-2020 dataset. This dataset combines two (2) years’ worth of survey data and includes features that cover data collection in the areas of child and family health measures, national performance and outcome measures, and subgroups. This is the most recently published dataset from the NSCH, derived from The Child & Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative, published in January of 2022.
