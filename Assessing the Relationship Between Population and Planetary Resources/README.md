As the developed world continues to become even more developed, the usage of our planet’s natural resources becomes a critical issue to consider. Not only does development impact environmental resource consumption, but one would ascertain that so does population increase – with more inhabitants on planet earth, there are fewer resources per capita. In the United Nations IPCC 2021 report on climate change (IPCC, 2021), a strong call to action was made – primarily citing human influence as one of the primary drivers of environmental decline and thus proposing escalated control and reduction of both human resource usage and human carbon footprints as an imperative solution. While this report focused specifically on climate change and its influencing factors, I would like to explore the issue of the depletion and availability of natural resources and the change in those resources across time. Additionally, I believe it is critical to not only consider historical data in this case, but to predict the landscape (no pun intended) of natural resources in the coming years utilizing predictive modeling of the data. Not only is this a crucial issue to explore and to formulate solutions for as it pertains to the earth, but for every living person now and those to come. By utilizing historical data trends regarding natural resources, we can forecast for tomorrow, and implement plans and solutions today to mitigate further degradation of the environment.

Given the discussions surrounding climate change, natural resource decline, the degradation of our planet, population overload, and wealth/dvelopment impacting resource usage one would surmise that enough alarm bells have resounded regarding the health and well-being of our planet. Put more plainly, much stress has been placed upon our planet and its resources, and if control is not exercised to minimize any damage, those living on this planet in the generations to come may have a more difficult time living and the landscape of survival may change. The issue of planetary and environmental harm is not just an issue of environmental ethics, but of the ethics surrounding human life, too.

Questions:

1.	Does a country’s population impact its availability or decline of natural resources?
2.	Does a country’s wealth impact its availability or decline of natural resources? 
3.	Are any of the relationships between a country’s wealth (GDP) and its population significant?
4.	Which countries have experienced the greatest decline in natural resources including water, forests, natural materials, wildlife, petroleum, and protected land?
5.	What do the natural resource changes look like across time?
6.	Is there a correlation between those changes and the changes in a country’s population or GDP?
7.	Based on the historical data that is available related to these topics, can we make accurate predictions regarding the future of our planet’s natural resources?


This project will seek to answer the above questions via EDA and time series analysis.
