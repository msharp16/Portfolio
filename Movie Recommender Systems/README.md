Using the small MovieLens data set, I created a few recommender systems that allow users to input a movie they would like (in the data set) and the system subsequently recommends ten other movies for them to watch.

Please Note: For this assignment, I decided to try a few different methods and compare them to see the outcomes and how similar or dissimilar they were.

Methodologies:

    - The first method I used was a more content-based method that focused on movie tags to make the ten other movie recommendations. 
    - The second method focused on using correlation to make movie recommendations (so making a recommendation based upon how correlated it was with the movie choice entered). 
    - Lastly, the final method (KNN) was a collaborative type recommender method.
