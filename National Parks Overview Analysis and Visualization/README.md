National Parks are a precious source of natural land and life and are one of the United States' best efforts with respect to conservation. As someone who appreciates National Parks, I wanted to learn a bit more about them, thus selecting this for my term project topic. I obtained data from a variety of sources and source types and utilized that data to discover a few insights about National Parks in the US.

A large portion of this project centered on cleaning the various data sources that we obtained. The three data source types used within my project included flat-file sources, web sources, and an API source. Each of these various sources required its own cleansing steps via a variety of means and methods. For example, the ways in which I handled and cleaned the flat-file sources were not necessarily the same ways in which I handled my other two sources. 

	Overall, to complete this project, I had to embark through the following steps:
-	Identify project topic
-	Locate data sources (flat-file sources, web sources, and an API source)
-	Import that data
-	Cleanse and transform the data for each source
-	Load the data into an SQL database (as 3 tables)
-	Merge those 3 loaded tables together
-	Query that data, convert to a pandas dataframe, and then utilize to create 5 visualizations
