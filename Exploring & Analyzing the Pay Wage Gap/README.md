Addressing a company’s pay gap related to gender and race is about more than just money – it is just as much about equity. Given the current socio-political climate, completing equity analyses to close that gap are at the forefront of myriad organizations’ minds; after all, closing this gap can bolster business performance, it benefits those who need it most, and it can strengthen the global economy. As our world moves closer to equitable solutions, closing the wage gap is imperative for keeping and maintaining strong employees who offer culture add and much-needed perspectives within the workforce. Happier and more diverse workforces that prioritize equitable treatment and inclusion experience increased productivity, adaptability, and balance.

The areas I will be exploring relative to this topic are encompassed within my research questions, which include:
1.	What does the current income landscape look like with respect to:
  a.	Gender?
  b.	Marital Status/Role in Household?
  c.	Race?
  d.	Ethnicity?
  e.	Age?
  f.	Educational Level?
2.	What does the current income landscape for data professionals look like with respect to:
  a.	Gender?
  b.	Job Title?
  c.	Country?
  d.	Industry/Sector?
  e.	Years of Experience?
  f.	Management Level?
3.	How do these two areas compare? What similarities or differences exist?

Via EDA, descriptive statistics, and linear and multivariate regression, the above will be addressed.
