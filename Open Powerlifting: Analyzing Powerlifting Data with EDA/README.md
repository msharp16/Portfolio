This data set includes data that encompasses a snapshot of the OpenPowerlifting database as of February 2018. OpenPowerlifting is an organization that tracks meets and competitor results in the sport of powerlifting. Powerlifting as a sport is defined by three lifts: the backsquat, the bench press, and the deadlift. More specifically, in this sport, competitors receive three "attempts" for each lift (9 lift attempts total) and then receive a final aggregate score of their highest lift for each of the three lifts. Competition placement is then awarded based upon the most weight lifted per weight class and age category. 

Some questions that I would like to explore within this data set include:

    - What is the relationship between overall bodyweight and lifting ability/capacity (in kilograms)?
        - I would like to look at both absolute strength and relative strength.
    - What is the age distribution of all of the lifters?
        - I would like to look at age overall as well as age by gender.
    - Based on the above:
        - What insights can we find about strength?
        - What gender differences exist within the sport?
