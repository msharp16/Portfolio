In this project, I assessed an employee dataset and used ML techniques (clustering) in an endeavor to predict employee attrition rates.
For this term project, I will be assessing employee attrition, specifically utilizing an IBM employee dataset. 

Employees are the backbone of any organization, company, or business. Therefore, an organization's performance and outcomes are heavily dependent upon the quality of employees and retaining said employees. In particular, certain challenges that an organization may face (in this specific use-case, IBM) due to employee attrition are:
* Additional costs of both money and time to obtain and train new employees.
* Costs already spent (money and time) on employees who are no longer with the company.
* Loss of experienced employees/employees who are familiar with the organization and its respective business sectors/industries, products, processes, etc.
* Impacts on profits.

Problem: 
Overall, the main problem I would like to solve/question I would like to answer here is: what factors or variables contribute to employee attrition?
Additionally, a follow up problem/question includes:
        1. Can predictions be made as to which employees are at the highest risk for attrition based upon those variables?

* Organization: The specific organization that would benefit from this would be IBM, given this is an IBM specific dataset. More broadly, a variety of businesses and organizations could benefit from an employee attrition study and analysis (especially during this economic time and the "Great Resignation" that is currently taking place in our COVID-era world).
* Target for model: Attrition value (a classification variable: yes = employee is no longer with the organization, no = employee is still present at the organization).
* Predictor for model: A variety of variables will be used as predictors or independent variables. The variables I decide to choose will be dependent upon my findings following EDA.
