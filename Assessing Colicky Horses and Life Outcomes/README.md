For this project, I analyzed a colicky horse dataset relative to the horseâ€™s biomarkers and to see which biomarkers were related to which life outcomes (lived, died, was euthanized).

Dataset:
The dataset I am using for the project is a flat-file source (.csv file) and the data can be obtained/accessed from the below places:
1. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Horse+Colic
2. https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/horse-colic?select=datadict.txt

Dataset description:
* This dataset consists of data from colicky horses. 

Variables:
* The original dataset includes a total of 28 variables.
* I will be using 11 of those variables for my project.

Problem: 
Overall, the main problem I would like to solve/question I would like to answer here is: what factors or variables contribute to a horse's colic outcome (lived, died, was euthanized)?

This project attempts to answer this question via a variety of analysis measures.
