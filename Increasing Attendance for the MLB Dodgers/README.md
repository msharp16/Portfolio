For this project, I used data on the Los Angeles Dodgers Major League Baseball (MLB) team. The data was in a flat-file .csv format (dodgers.csv). Overall, the goal of this project was to use this data in any way or any unlimited number of ways to make a recommendation to management on how to improve attendance. 

From what I know about baseball (my limited knowledge!) and from what I have learned about baseball (I have someone to whom I am quite close who is very knowledgeable about baseball, played for a good portion of his life, is well-versed in baseball analytics, etc.), as I think about this project and my project steps, the following comes to mind:

    Given that the Giants and the Snakes (Diamondbacks) are the Dodgers rival teams, there may be an uptick in attendance during those games.
        The uptick in attendance may also be present in games where a divisional opponent is also present (any opponent that is in the Dodgers' division).
        The division teams include:
            Rockies
            Snakes (Diamondbacks)
            Giants
            Padres
    Promotional item games (those games in which a free promotional item is given out), may result in higher attendance (a "free" incentive for people to attend).
    Season opening day may accrue higher attendance as well.

The questions that I would like to ask/explore with respect to this dataset include:

    Which variables appear to have the greatest impact on attendance?
    Are there any variable combinations that have a high impact on attendance, versus just one single variable?
    Overall, which variables may be the best predictors for attendance outcomes?
    What type of model might be a good fit to assess and predict this, and how successful might that model be in terms of accuracy and recall?

My analysis plan for this project work includes:

    Pulling in the data and completing any tranformations as needed.
    Completing an EDA on the data - both with descriptives and visualizations.
    Assessing variable relationships with correlations and visualizations.
    Creating an analysis on the data as it relates to "attend" being the target variable.
    Making an overall assessment of how the Dodgers might improve attendance of their games based on my analysis work.
